-> Before adding relation b/w user and product, anybody can add a product. But next we are going to establish one to many 
   reln , where user is parent and product is child. So only a valid user can add a product. It is achieved by updating 
   logic inside postProduct controller and since right now we have no logic to fauthenticate user is making request, we are using
   middleware to by default add first user in user table, by appending user propert with value first user in req.params. I faced
   circular dependency problem while doing this.
