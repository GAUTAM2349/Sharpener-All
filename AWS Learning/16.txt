Instances types 

* their are more than 500 instances types and it keeps increasing...u just need to know their roles

* t2.micro
    t-> class of instance    2-> generation    micro -> size of memeory (nano smallest)



Classes of instances (types) :-

1> General purpose :- when ratio of uses of resources is known in advance, like if their is 1 cpu then 2gb or ram will be required, if 2 cpu then 4gb of ram will be required, with same network bandwidth. t2micro comes under this category.

2>  Compute optimized :- high cpu
3>  Memeory optimized :- high ram
4>  Accelerated computing :- high gpu
5>  Storage Optimized :- high read and write operations occuring situation, where frequen write and reads are performed on data. Used with databases like rdbms...
