* by default ebs keeps a replica of your ebs volume in same availability zone then u can get same data.

* ebs volumes are kept in SAN (storage area network - area specialised to keep data storages). So data comes to you through
  a network this causes a latency, but very minimal in case of cloud providers, usually negligible.

* Then also u can create an instance with storage in same physical infra where instance is hosted. This is called 
  Ec2 instance with Instance-store storage.

* But in this case if your instance is terminated then you storage is lost, unlike ec2 with ebs storage.
* you can see the process to create it..present in video    

* we can take an ebs from one availability zone to another but with help of SNAPSHOT.

* Their are 6 types of ebs, out of which 2 can be shared to any number of instance and 4 are for one instance only.
