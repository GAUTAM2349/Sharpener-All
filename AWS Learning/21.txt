
* since default ip that we get on ec2 is dynamic, ie. it changes every time instance is restarted. So one can not rely on it   
  to host websites. Here comes need of

* their is option for ELASTIC IP in Network and Security option of ec2 dashboard. We can get static ip's from their.
* we get options to select this ip during instance creation or can associate after creation.
* in elast ip dashboard u can get all static ip's and instance associated with it.
* By default u can create maximum 5 static ip's but u can get more by mailing aws... we will see how later..




* Elastic IPs are free as long as they are associated with a running EC2 instance.
* AWS charges you only when the Elastic IP is allocated but not in use, to discourage hoarding.

* Classful ip addresing is now depricated in favor of CIDR.

* Now ip addresses are managed on basis of subnet mask

* AWS have acquired 3.0.0.0/8, 44, ect.. as it's ip.
* it assigns different subnets to different regions
* and have provision to provide free ip's available to different end users.
* 

*   The private IP ranges defined in RFC 1918 include:

10.0.0.0 – 10.255.255.255 (Class A equivalent)
172.16.0.0 – 172.31.255.255 (Class B equivalent)
192.168.0.0 – 192.168.255.255 (Class C equivalent)

  it does not mean that classful ip is used in private addressing. They exist because they were not assined  to anyone.
