
SEE ALL INSTANCE INFORMATION ON INSTANCE'S SHELL - 

Use :- Aws don't provide same public ip to your instance everytime it restarts. So any decision based on your ip address or any other instance related info will  
       have to written if hardcoded. So in BOOTSTRAP script we use these command to get these information dynamically.

* used "ip a" command to see ip address in linux shell (ubuntu)


*  to get all instance info on shell , we use command  "curl 169.254.169.254". They call it MAGIC ip

*  then we get list of different versions , and at last their will be version named 'latest'

* to use that version we will execute command  "curl 169.254.169.254/latest". ie. just adding '/latest' after it as if it is a file inside it.

* then two more options will come 1> Dynamic data  2> Meta-Data

* then their will be many otptions for various meta data's like (ami id, public-ipv4, security groups, ami id, host name, instance id.....). Options with '/' at the end
  will have more options inside them.
















*** like we have public ip and many devices resides under it with different private ip address, similary we have public ip and private ip for ec2. 
    Since u are using shared or multi-tennant infrastructure, so public ip is gate way to the main physical infrastructure and private ip is 
    address to host (ie. your instance within that physical infrastructure).

*** public dns is based on public ip.
*** host is private dns, which is of no use in NAT, so by default ec2 uses private dns as instance's host name.
