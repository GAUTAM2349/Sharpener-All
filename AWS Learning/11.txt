1> Their are different ways to access ec2 instance created by us. (ip,ssh)

2> you can click on "connect" option after selecting instance, it will give u the command to get into your
   instance.
   
3> Since by default we get specific (ap-south-1a)   zone inside Mumbai region, so accordingly everybody who are
    not manually changing region should be creating instance in this region, and this should be flooded.
    BUT this is not the case. Aws mananges this by mapping same zone name to different zones for different users
    to overcome this pbm. ie. same zone name for other user can map to other zone in the region.
