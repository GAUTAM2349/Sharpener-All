

* In ec2 dashboard option their is section for EBS. you can create ebs storage from their.

* You need to be attentive about availability zone you are selecting (not region);

* region is available in nav bar whereas availability zone (subnet) is to be selected in network settings while creating instance.

*  Their are 3 availability zones in ap-south-1 (Mumbai), 1a,1b, 1c (all in Mumbai)

* You can also create more ebs while creating instance, but those WILL NOT BE ROOT EBS. ONLY ONE EBS IS ROOT EBS (WHERE OPERATING SYSTEM IS INSTALLED).
* This created ebs will also be shown in ebs dashboard.

* "lsblk" command is used to view attached ebs to an instance.

* Now let's try to assign ebs to running instances.
* You observe that you get to select only those instance which are in same zone and running.
* after adding an ebs to instance you can check it again their will be more ebs volumes attached usin "lsblk" command.

* Now let's see how can we use thos instances.


* steps :- theory first

    we have some ebs attached, let us take ebs named 'xvdf'

    u will do all these thing in root directory. So u need to go to "cd /"  

 1> first format the device or partition (ebs attached to instance) using command   " sudo mkfs.ext4 /dev/xvdf".
    mkfs.ext4 is new standard of file system in linux. It has some features , see..
    By default all devices (or partition) attached to linux system, are in /dev directory.
    See to create files in a device u need to give a filesystem ( way to handle file related things or can think as a file manager). 
    what this command does is, goes to your attached device(ebs), and installs a new file system ext4 (type of file system). It makes sense that 
    their can only one file system, to manage file, so whatevery file system existing earlier, will be removed , hence file inside it will also be 
    removed, so that device is basically formatted in this way. We are doing this because we are using this device for first time but, usually it's not
    good idea to format a device before being assured it doesn't contain any data.
        // if u forget sudo in above command u can write "sudo !!" 
        

2> Now second thing is to mount this device(ebs) to your instance, ie. if u keep some file their it goes to that ebs.
   
    u need to create a directory(test) where u will mount your ebs.  

    "mount dev/xvd "
    -> it will show u all xvd's available. 'XVD' IS THE PREFIX USED FOR EBS VOLUMES IN AWS. u can use this command for reference to see available ebs

    "mount dev/xvdf  /test/"    because xvdf is device we want to mount, and /test/ is location on instance where we want to mount
 
 
 /*  By default when u get into linux shell u are insid home directory. If u type "sudo su" then u go to root user but  
   their also home directory of root user. To  get into root directory( where every dirctory starts) then u need to 
    type command "cd /". Here u will get all the directories at first level of linux system. You need to go their because
    you need to do sth with device connected to your linux instance, this not available inside home directory, these are 
    hardware level things and are available in root directory. /dev contains all attached or partitioned devices */



3> You successfully mounted ebs device to your instance , but if u want to check wheter it happened or not, "mountpoint /test/ " it
   will tell you wheter or not /test/ is a mounted area.
